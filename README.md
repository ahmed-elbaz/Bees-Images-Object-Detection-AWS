In this project we will use Object Detection Algorithm in Amazon Sagemaker to detect Bees in a certain image. we will use a dataset from the inaturalist.org This dataset contains 500 images of bees that have been uploaded by inaturalist users for the purposes of recording the observation and identification. We only used images that their users have licensed under CC0 license.
